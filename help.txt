JSX gets transpiled into ES5 by webpack and babel


When you create a component/function it is actually a class and you need to instantiate it and pass to ReactDOM

In render method we need to pass an object of an class.
When we write
<div> it converts to React.createElement(Name)

Include React whenever we are using JSX.

There are function based components and also Class based functions.

Every class must have render method


whenever we are writing JSX and using Javascript variables  which distort input changes we wrap it with curly braces.


State is an simple javascript object which records the changes and we initialize it in constructor.
State can only be initialized in Class based functions.

Only in our constructor we use 
this.state = Object;

Everywhere else we use this.setState() method to change the state.

To modify the value of state use this.setState().

To read the value we can use this.state.name in {} because it is a javascript variable.

In controlled components the state changes the value and not the other way around.

When we update the state the component re renders. Important


Downward data flow concept in react says that the parent class should obtain the data and then it should pass data to children classes.

When we pass data from parent component to child component it is in the form of props.
In functional component props is passed as a parameter and in class based component it is available anywhere by referencing this.props


To iterate in React we use Maps and not for loops
which takes a video indivisually and then


When we pass Data in form of this.state.videos 
it is taken at receivers end in props

And to access it we need to use props.videos

E.g Props is used to pass data from one component to another component
